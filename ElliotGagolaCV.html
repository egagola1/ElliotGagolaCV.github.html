<p>-	I also evaluated the way data was handled in the company, implementing improvements to make it easier and faster to manipulate. This was on the back of some enhancements I made to some of the company’s existing spreadsheets, and I received such positive feedback that the company asked me to assess all their spreadsheets and provide improvements.

          <p>BEng Mechanical Engineering 2:2</p>
          <p>In my second year I studied electric circuits, building on the foundation of my electronics A level. I have a good understanding of circuits, having designed and built an ultrasonic tape measure. I enjoyed the module as it involved a lot of problem solving and practical development.</p>

<p>In my final year, I led a group project to design a quality control machine to sit on an assembly line, assessing bottles for damage and mislabelling through visual inspection using an array of cameras. The machine would then accept or reject the bottles. This gave me experience working in a multicultural group and improved my ability to communicate information and reason through my decision making.</p>

<p>Final Year Project Topic: Widening Participation in Engineering.</p>
<p>With the aim to understand and overcome barriers that prevent women from pursuing STEM subjects in higher education and employment. My final proposal linked schools with local engineering businesses, aiming to build relationships between students and employers by providing work experience and tuition in a more personal way, thus providing students with information about engineering practice to dispel stereotypes surrounding the industry.</p>
